### So, I could quickly record for a minute ... 

look at the data cost of that minute and scale it to all of the minutes in a day.
math ... 1 day = 1440 minutes

### But does this hold in reality?<br>and is it fun?

well, is having a camera running for 24 hours fun. 
<br>not particularly. But I havent tried it yet. 
<br>I bet its a logistics nightmare. (plan to use 2 cameras and just ignore them.)

also, what is the edit time?

I want to edit this thing fast.
<br> see if this is a viable thing.
